<h2>Notes regarding the project</h2>
<h3>Setup Test Environment</h3>
<h4> Starting the test server</h4>

Install dependencies with npm install. Then simply run npm run-script npm start. This will start the development server on port 3000. This setup includes hot reloading of react components, so styling and development should be very fast.
